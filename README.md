# Netflix-SQL-Data-Analysis-Project
This project analyzes Netflix’s content catalog using SQL to solve 15 real-world business problems.   The queries explore key aspects such as content type, genre trends, ratings, directors, and actor appearances.   Each problem reflects a realistic analytical scenario for understanding Netflix’s data-driven decisions.
